This is my first post on my this blog!

I'm excited to be doing this and I hope to be able to write a lot about what I'm learning each week.

I'm currently taking a CS degree and today while working on some labs and assignments, I figured out I was learning quite a lot already.

I want to journal some new things each week. In a way this will be excerpts from my learning journals from my school work,
but it will also provide me an avenue to delve deeper and research on these topics as they come to me.
